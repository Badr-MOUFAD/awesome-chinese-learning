# learning-chinese
Repository to share resources and tips that can help when learning chinese.

## Tools and techniques:

### Flashcard

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is the default app for flashcards on android and windows.

**Deck**  
The deck that I use extensively is the one I found on reddit: ["Best Anki Deck for HSK I've come across"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/7mjmjc/best_anki_deck_for_hsk_ive_come_across/)

**Settings**  
Guide for setting up the intervals and the number of cards on ANKI, I _strongly_ advise people to watch it before or when starting to use flashcard extensively.

### Browser extension

**[Zhongwen](https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen)**
 
Chrome and Firefox extension to highlight words in the browser.
It is possible to add the hovered vocabulary to a list by pressing "R". The list can be accessed using "Alt + W".
The vocabularies can thereafter be downloaded and added to ANKI.

### Learning how to write

[How to write Chinese character](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ansami.hkchinesechar&hl=en_US&gl=US) is an excellent android application to learn stroke orders as well as how to write characters.

# learning-chinese
Repository to share resources and tips that can help when learning chinese.

## Flashcards
### Application
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is the default app for flashcards on android and windows.

### Deck  
The deck that I use extensively is the one I found on reddit: ["Best Anki Deck for HSK I've come across"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/7mjmjc/best_anki_deck_for_hsk_ive_come_across/)

### Settings  
Training vocabulary with flashcards will take quite some time. It is therefore _strongly_ recommended to finely tune the settings of the deck before using it extensively.

## [Zhongwen](https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen)(Browser extension)
Zhongwen is a Chinese pop-up dictionary for browser (Chrome, Firefox, ...). It is useful to get the translation of specific word in a page by hovering the word with the mouse.

It is also possible to add the hovered vocabulary to a list by pressing "R". The list can be accessed using "Alt + W".

_Extra tip 1:_ The vocabularies can thereafter be downloaded and added to ANKI.

_Extra tip 2:_ If you have some text that you want to analyze using the browser extension zhongwen, you can paste it in [awfice](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/zserge/awfice/blob/main/edit.html) .



## Dictionaries
Two main chinese-english dictionaries are popular:
1. Pleco
2. Hanping

Both have a free version and a version where you have a one time purchase to get more vocabulary (defintely worth it). Some comparisons exist on the internet. 

## Translator
1. Google translate : Best translator, however not available in China.
2. [Bing translator](https://www.bing.com/translator) : Works in china.
3. [Baidu translator](https://fanyi.baidu.com/#zh/en/)

## Ressources

### Netflix
Netflix can be used to learn chinese ! This works the browser (at least Mozilla), two extensions are needed, and some hacks needs to be done :
1. Install [Zhongwen](https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen)
2. Install [Subfilter](https://github.com/met/subfilter)
3. Go to the show or movie that you want to watch, change the languge from the extension Subfilter to _Simplified Chinese_. (The media do need to have Chinese subtitles avalaible.)
4. Press F11 to put if full screen (Zhongwen does not work full screen on Netflix).

### XuetangX
The equivalent of coursera in Chinese, you can use the Zhongwen + F11 Mode in order to have the possibility of dictionary pop-up when watching classes.

## Viki
There is some shows with subtitles in Chinese with a direct look up when clicking on them. It is extremely well made, however the selection of shows having the feature was quite poor several years ago.

## Bilibili
Equivalent of youtube. Howener, in contrast to youtube, netflix, ..., the platform does not have built in subtitles. It is therefore less convinient to learn Chinese with this platform.

### [Chinese Zero To Hero](https://chinesezerotohero.teachable.com/courses) 
Many courses on chinese, works as a one time purchase. Very clean and well made. They are based on the books from BLCU.

### Others
1. [Youku (优酷)](https://www.youku.com/)
2. [iQIYI (爱奇艺)](https://www.iqiyi.com/)
3. [MangoTV (芒果TV)](https://w.mgtv.com/) (It has for example 爸爸去哪儿)

## Miscalleneous
### Douban
The main website to watch the score of different movies/TV shows. It is the equivalent of IMDB.  
If you want to search very specific TV shows, you can take a look at the tool I wrote : [douban-crawler](https://github.com/thomashirtz/douban-crawler)
### [chinese-shadowing](https://github.com/thomashirtz/chinese-shadowing)
It is a small tool I wrote in order to do some shadowing using the deck mentionned in the Flashcards section. 

### [How to write Chinese character](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ansami.hkchinesechar&hl=en_US&gl=US) (Android application)

It is an excellent android application to learn stroke order as well as to learn how to write characters.

### Pop-up dictionary on documents 
One of the main trick I used while studying in China. You can convert many different format into PDFs (by printingthem). You can then convert them into HTML and use them in the browser to have a pop up dictionary with zhongwen.

Note: You might have to give Zhongwen permission to access files on your local file system, at least on Chrome.

### Novels in HTML
Some Chinese novels are avaliable for free online in an HTML format. It is perfect for our new favorite trick, the pop-up dictionary.

Example of free book : [三体](https://www.shizongzui.cc/santi/),

### Chinese OCR
Some Chinese OCRs for converting an image to text using the computer (It can be quite useful if you want to get e.g. the list of a vocabulary on your chinese textbook into your Anki decks).
1. [Convertio](https://convertio.co/ocr/chinese/)
2. [Easy ScreenOCR](https://online.easyscreenocr.com/Home/ChineseOCR)
